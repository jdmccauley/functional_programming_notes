Lambda Calculus in Python:
Now that I understand the use of lambda calculus, time to understand its syntax in python.
Syntax:
	my_func = lambda a : a + 1
	my_func2 = lambda a,b : a + b
It's pretty simple, just the Î» is  changed to 'lambda', only one 'lambda' is needed for multiple input variables, and the output is encoded after a colon.

Use:
	x_plus_1 = my_func(5)
	#Returns 6
	x_plus_y = my_func2(5, 1)
	#Returns 6

For pandas dataframes, you can modify a dataframe in place without making a separate lambda function. You can do this using df.apply()

Example:
	df.apply(
		lambda column: column + 5
		axis = 1
	)
This performs the lamdba function on the dataframe column.
Note that when 'axis = 1', the function is performed on columns, while when 'axis = 0', the function is performed on rows.
